In some cases, however, PTC can worsen the convergence behavior, especially when the initial conditions are similar to the solution.  When the initial conditions are similar to, or exactly the same as, the solution and convergence is slow, then the NO\\_PTC FIRST option should be used to deactivate PTC for the first stress period.  The NO\\_PTC ALL option should also be used in order to compare convergence behavior with other MODFLOW versions, as PTC is only available in MODFLOW 6."
